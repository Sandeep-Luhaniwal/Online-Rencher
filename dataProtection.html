            However, if a data subject wishes to use our company's special
            services via our website, processing of personal data may become
            necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and
            there is no legal basis for such processing, we generally obtain
            the consent of the data subject.

          reasons, a confirmation email will be sent using the double opt-in
          procedure to the email address entered by a data subject for the
          first time to receive the newsletter. This confirmation email is

          Sternad Software GmbH’s newsletters contain so-called tracking
          pixels. A web beacon is a miniature graphic that is embedded in
          emails sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and log file
          analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or
          failure of online marketing campaigns to be carried out. Based on
          the embedded tracking pixel, Sternad Software GmbH can determine
          whether and when an email was opened by a data subject and which
          links in the email were accessed by the data subject.

        <p class="sm:text-base text-sm font-normal text-shark leading-[20.16px] sm:mb-10 mb-5">
          Such personal data collected via the tracking pixels contained in
          the newsletters are stored and evaluated by the person responsible
          for processing in order to optimize the sending of the newsletter
          and to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the
          interests of the data subject. This personal data will not be passed
          on to third parties. Affected persons are entitled at any time to
          revoke the relevant separate declaration of consent issued via the
          double opt-in procedure. After revocation, these personal data will

          click or sale commissions, on third-party Internet sites, i.e. with
          sales partners who are also affiliates or publishers to be shown.
          The merchant provides an advertising medium via the affiliate
          network, i.e. an advertising banner or other suitable means of
          internet advertising, which is subsequently integrated by an

          The person responsible for processing has integrated the Google
          Analytics component (with anonymization function) on this website.
          Google Analytics is a web analysis service. Web analysis is the
          collection, collection and evaluation of data about the behavior of
          visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, among other
          things, data about the website from which a data subject came to a
          website (so-called referrer), which sub-pages of the website were
          accessed or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed.
          Web analysis is primarily used to optimize a website and to analyze
          the cost-benefit of internet advertising.

          this addition, the IP address of the data subject's Internet
          connection is shortened and anonymized by Google if our website is
          accessed from a member state of the European Union or from another

          This browser add-on tells Google Analytics via JavaScript that no
          data or information about website visits may be transmitted to
          Google Analytics. Installing the browser add-on is viewed by Google
          as a contradiction. If the information technology system of the data

          data subject must reinstall the browser add-on in order to
          deactivate Google Analytics. If the browser add-on is uninstalled or

          Each time you access one of the individual pages of this website,

          automatically activated by the respective Instagram component
          prompted to download a representation of the corresponding component
          from Instagram. As part of this technical process, Instagram gains
          knowledge of which specific subpage of our website is visited by the

          If the data subject is logged in to Instagram at the same time,
          Instagram recognizes which specific subpage the data subject visits
          each time the data subject visits our website and for the entire
          duration of their stay on our website. This information is collected
          by the Instagram component and assigned by Instagram to the
          respective Instagram account of the data subject. If the data
          subject clicks on one of the Instagram buttons integrated on our
          website, the data and information transmitted will be assigned to
          the data subject's personal Instagram user account and stored and

          logged in to Instagram at the same time as accessing our website;
          This takes place regardless of whether the data subject clicks on

          site's visitors. By displaying related posts and publications or the
          ability to share content on the site, it is also possible to
          increase visitor numbers. In addition, security functions are
          integrated into Jetpack, so that a website using Jetpack is better

          the respective Jetpack component to retrieve data for analysis
          purposes to be sent to Automattic. As part of this technical
          process, Automattic receives knowledge of data that is subsequently
          used to create an overview of website visits. The data obtained in
          this way is used to analyze the behavior of the data subject who
          accessed the website of the controller and is evaluated with the aim
          of optimizing the website. The data collected via the Jetpack
          component will not be used to identify the data subject without
          first obtaining a separate, express consent from the data subject.

          The person responsible for processing has integrated Twitter
          components on this website. Twitter is a multilingual, publicly
          accessible microblogging service on which users can publish and
          distribute so-called tweets, i.e. short messages limited to 280
          characters. These short messages are available to everyone,
          including people who are not logged in to Twitter. The tweets are
          also displayed to the so-called followers of the respective user.
          Followers are other Twitter users who follow a user's tweets.
          Twitter also makes it possible to address a broad audience via
          hashtags, links or retweets.

        </h2>
        <p class="sm:text-base text-sm font-normal text-shark leading-[20.16px] mb-4">
          Art. 6 I lit. a GDPR serves our company as the legal basis for
          processing operations in which we obtain consent for a specific
          processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary
          for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a
          party, as is the case, for example, with processing operations that
          are necessary for the delivery of goods or the provision of any
          other service or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 I
          lit. b GDPR. The same applies to processing operations that are
          necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures, for example in
          cases of inquiries about our products or services. If our company is
          subject to a legal obligation that requires the processing of
          personal data, such as to fulfill tax obligations, the processing is
          based on Art. 6 I lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of
          personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the
          data subject or another natural person. This would be the case, for
          example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age,
          health insurance details or other vital information would then have
          to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party.

        <p class="sm:text-base text-sm font-normal text-shark leading-[20.16px] sm:mb-[29px] mb-5">
          Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d GDPR.
          Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f
          GDPR. Processing operations that are not covered by any of the
          above-mentioned legal bases are based on this legal basis if the
          processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our
          company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental
          rights and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail. We are
          permitted to carry out such processing operations in particular
          because they have been specifically mentioned by the European
          legislator. In this respect, he was of the opinion that a legitimate
          interest could be assumed if the data subject is a customer of the
          controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).

          The criterion for the duration of storage of personal data is the
          respective statutory retention period. After the deadline has

        </h2>
        <p class="sm:text-base text-sm font-normal text-shark leading-[20.16px] mb-4">
          We would like to clarify that the provision of personal data is
          partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result
          from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual
          partner). In order to conclude a contract, it may sometimes be
          necessary for a data subject to provide us with personal data, which
          must subsequently be processed by us.
        </p>
        <p class="sm:text-base text-sm font-normal text-shark leading-[20.16px] mb-4">
          For example, the data subject is obliged to provide us with personal
          data if our company enters into a contract with them. Failure to
          provide the personal data would mean that the contract with the
          person concerned could not be concluded. Before the data subject
          provides personal data, the data subject must contact one of our
          employees.
        </p>
        <p class="sm:text-base text-sm font-normal text-shark leading-[20.16px] sm:mb-[29px] mb-5">
          Our employee will inform the data subject on a case-by-case basis
          whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or
          contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether
          there is an obligation to provide the personal data and what
          consequences the non-provision of the personal data would have.
